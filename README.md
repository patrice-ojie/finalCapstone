# Sentiment Analysis

## Description
This project is an application of Natural Language Processing with a function that is set up to take text as input and return a label of either Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

## Installation
You can fork a copy of the code to use and amend as you see fit.

## Usage
In order for the file in the code to be found, you will need to download a copy here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products and save it as a csv file, naming it amazon_product_reviews.csv. If the file isn't found, check that it is saved in the __same__ folder as the Python file. If not, make changes as necessary.
